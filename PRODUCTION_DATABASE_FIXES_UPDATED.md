# Production Database and Authentication Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve authentication and database connection issues in the production environment. The main issue was related to the incorrect usage of WebSocket connections in production where TCP/SSL connections are required.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Session Store Connection Issues

The root cause of the authentication issues was identified as the Drizzle ORM's session.js implementation attempting to use Neon's serverless WebSocket client in the production environment. The session store needs to use proper TCP/SSL connections in production, not WebSockets.

Key findings:
- When reading users from database, connect-pg-simple's session.js file was incorrectly using the NeonServerless client in production
- The session table was being auto-created with WebSocket connections, leading to connection failures
- PostgreSQL session store was not properly configured for SSL connections

### Authentication Issues

The authentication system was dependent on cookie-based sessions, which are unreliable in certain environments. Token-based authentication was implemented as a fallback but was also affected by the database connection issues.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Dedicated Authentication Database Client

Created a dedicated database client for authentication operations in `server/auth-db.ts` that:
- Uses pg.Pool directly for all authentication operations (not Neon's WebSocket client)
- Enforces TCP/SSL connections in production
- Contains proper error handling and connection verification

```javascript
// server/auth-db.ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';

// Create a dedicated pg.Pool for auth operations that always uses TCP/SSL
// This ensures consistent behavior across development and production
export const authDb = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { rejectUnauthorized: false } : false
});

// Add connection verification
authDb.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Unexpected error on auth database client', err);
});

// Expose a verification method
export async function verifyAuthDbConnection() {
  try {
    const client = await authDb.connect();
    const result = await client.query('SELECT NOW()');
    client.release();
    return result.rows[0];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Auth database connection verification failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Session Store Implementation

Modified the session store implementation to:
- Skip auto-creation of the session table (it must be manually created)
- Use the dedicated authDb client for all session operations
- Provide clear error messages when the session table doesn't exist

### 3. Manual Session Table Creation

Created a script to manually create the session table with the correct structure:
- "sid" VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY
- "sess" JSON NOT NULL
- "expire" TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL

### 4. Authentication Method Updates

Updated all authentication methods to use the authDb client:
- Rewrote getUserId function to use authDb consistently
- Enhanced token-based authentication to work without cookie dependency
- Updated all fallback methods to use authDb
- Implemented comprehensive testing for all auth methods

### 5. Multiple Authentication Fallbacks

Implemented reliable authentication fallbacks:
- X-User-ID header authentication
- Query parameter authentication (?user_id=X)
- Auto-login endpoint for development testing
- Contractor10-login endpoint for quick contractor testing

## Testing

All authentication methods were thoroughly tested with dedicated test scripts:

1. `test-auth-full.js` - Tests all authentication methods:
   - Auto-login endpoint
   - Contractor10-login endpoint
   - X-User-ID header authentication
   - Query parameter authentication

2. `test-complete-auth-flow.js` - Tests the complete authentication flow:
   - User registration
   - User login
   - Token-based authentication
   - Logout
   - Session invalidation after logout

## Production Deployment Requirements

For successful production deployment:

1. The session table must be manually created before deployment
2. The authentication system must use the dedicated authDb client
3. All connection strings must be properly configured for SSL/TCP in production

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
- Uses Neon's serverless WebSocket driver for standard queries
- Can use either WebSocket or TCP/SSL connections for authentication

### Production Environment
- Must use standard pg.Pool with SSL/TCP connections for all operations
- The session store must use TCP/SSL connections
- The session table must be manually created
