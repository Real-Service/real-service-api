# Deployment Solution for Real Service API

We've created several solutions to fix the "Cannot find package 'vite'" error when deploying to Render.com.

## Root Cause

The main issue is that Render.com is looking for the compiled JavaScript file at `dist/index.js`, but our TypeScript configuration compiles it to `dist/server/index.js` instead.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Render.com Start Command (Simplest)

We've created `render-direct.yaml` that correctly points to where our compiled file actually exists:

```yaml
services:
  # Main API server
  - type: web
    name: real-service-api
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
    startCommand: node dist/server/index.js  # This is the critical fix
```

To use this:
1. Upload this YAML file to your Render.com blueprint
2. Or manually update the start command in your Render.com dashboard

### Option 2: Create a Symlink (Fallback)

The `render-build-fix.sh` script creates a symlink from where Render expects the file to where it actually is:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run the normal build process
npm ci && npm run build

# Create the symlink to fix the path issue
mkdir -p dist
ln -sf dist/server/index.js dist/index.js
```

To use this:
1. Set this script as your build command in Render
2. Keep the default start command as `node dist/index.js`

### Option 3: Update TypeScript Configuration

The `tsconfig.server.json` file changes where TypeScript compiles your server code:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": false,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "module": "NodeNext"
  },
  "include": ["server/**/*", "shared/**/*"]
}
```

The build script `build-server-only.sh` helps build just the server part of your application.

### Option 4: Standalone Deployment (Most Reliable)

For a completely standalone deployment without any build issues:

1. Use the pure JavaScript implementation in `deploy-pure-final/index.js`
2. This approach has no dependencies on Vite or TypeScript
3. Just copy the files to a new repository and deploy

## Implementation Steps

1. Choose your preferred solution from above
2. For Options 1-3: Make the necessary configuration changes on Render.com
3. For Option 4: Create a new repository with just the files from deploy-pure-final

## Testing Your Deployment

After deploying, check:
1. The `/healthz` endpoint to confirm the server is running
2. The `/api/status` endpoint to see detailed status
3. The `/api/database/test` endpoint to verify database connectivity

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check the Render logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure your database connection string is properly configured
