Root Cause (Final Version):
When your session store tries to connect to the database at boot,
the code that connects is still using NeonServerless (WebSocket), NOT pg.Pool TCP SSL.

Even though you have a pg.Pool,
the connect-pg-simple session store isn't being passed the right database connection
(or is trying to "create session table" automatically through the wrong method).

🛠 Here's exactly why it happens:
You have a pg.Pool instance (correct) ✅

But somewhere during session initialization (setupProductionSessionStore in your logs),
you're calling the wrong function to check/create the session table, and it's trying to use a drizzle client internally. ❌

Meaning: you are mixing correct TCP db pool + old Neon drizzle database connection together at startup.

📢 In plain English:
✅ The session table does exist in the database.
❌ Your app is still trying to "recreate or validate" the table using Neon serverless client code (drizzle serverless), which fails in production Replit.

🎯 Real Solution (No Band-Aids):
✅ You must completely remove or disable any automatic "session table creation/check" at startup.

You don't need to "check" or "create" the session table at app start anymore.

It already exists → just trust it.

✅ Only initialize the session store normally using the pg.Pool.

✅ Let connect-pg-simple-esm handle finding the table inside Postgres via TCP.

🛠 Correct Express Session Setup Code:
typescript
Copy
Edit
import session from 'express-session';
import connectPgSimple from 'connect-pg-simple-esm';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pgPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
});

const PgSession = connectPgSimple(session);

app.use(session({
  store: new PgSession({
    pool: pgPool, // ✅ No check/create scripts
    tableName: 'session',
  }),
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
  }
}));
✅ NO startup query.
✅ NO session table validation logic.
✅ NO drizzle client for sessions at all.
✅ Only TCP pg.Pool for session store.

🛡 After this:

✅	Result
Session store will initialize correctly	✅
Sessions will be saved to the session table	✅
No console errors about Neon/console request	✅
No fallback to memory store	✅
