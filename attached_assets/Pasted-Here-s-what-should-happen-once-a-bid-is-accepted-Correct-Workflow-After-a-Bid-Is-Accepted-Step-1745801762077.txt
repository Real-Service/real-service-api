Here’s what should happen once a bid is accepted:

🎯 Correct Workflow After a Bid Is Accepted

Step	What Should Happen	Why
1	Move the job into "My Jobs"	It's no longer an open opportunity — it's now a scheduled project
2	Lock the Bid Amount	The accepted bid becomes the official contract amount (unless later revised via formal change orders)
3	Create a Private Job Page	Both contractor and client can now see a shared page: timeline, notes, documents, messaging
4	Start a New Timeline	Create project milestones: start date, due date, update status (In Progress, On Hold, Completed)
5	Allow Messaging	Open a messaging thread tied specifically to that job, not tied to general platform chat
6	Restrict Re-bidding	No other contractors should be allowed to bid after acceptance. Hide from job marketplace
7	Allow Quote/Invoice Creation	Now that work is approved, allow contractor to:
Send final formal Quote (if needed)

Generate Invoices when work progresses |

// Replit Agent Prompt – Handle Bid Acceptance Workflow

When a contractor’s bid is accepted:

1. **Move the Job**
   - Remove the job from the public job marketplace.
   - Move it to the contractor's "My Jobs" section under "In Progress".

2. **Update Job Status**
   - Set status: `in progress`
   - Lock in the accepted bid amount.

3. **Create a Private Project Page**
   - Job Overview (start date, timeline, requirements)
   - Messaging thread between contractor and client
   - Ability to upload documents/photos
   - Ability to create formal quote or invoice if needed

4. **Messaging Activation**
   - Open job-specific messaging/chat between contractor and client.

5. **Restrict Further Bidding**
   - Close bidding entirely once acceptance occurs.
   - Other contractors cannot view or place bids.

6. **Notify Both Parties**
   - Send push/email notification confirming acceptance.

Ensure all state changes update in real-time and are fully visible to both contractor and client.
🚀 Summary: This Turns a "Bid" Into a "Project."
Handling this moment well means:

Contractors take your platform seriously

Clients feel confident the process is official

You build a real workflow ecosystem (not just a matching engine)
