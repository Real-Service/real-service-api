Translation:

Your production test query (your /health or startup query)

Is still hitting NeonServerless/WebSocket instead of using the correct TCP/SSL pg driver.

And because Replit blocks WebSocket/console requests in production deployments â†’ it fails.

ðŸŽ¯ So what this confirms:
âœ… Your Express app is alive.
âœ… Your session store is (almost) working.
âœ… BUT: Your production database connection is still incorrectly created with NeonPool instead of pg Pool.

ðŸ”¥ 100% Solution (same as I hinted above):
You must create your database client this way:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { Pool as PgPool } from 'pg';
import { NeonPool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/...';
import { neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import ws from 'ws'; // needed for dev mode

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

let db;

if (isProduction) {
  const pgPool = new PgPool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  });

  console.log('Using production Postgres pool for app DB');

  db = drizzle(pgPool, { schema });
} else {
  neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;

  const neonPool = new NeonPool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  });

  console.log('Using development Neon serverless pool');

  db = drizzle(neonPool, { schema });
}

export { db };
Notice:

âœ… pgPool (real TCP SSL connection) in production

âœ… neonPool (WebSocket connection) only in dev

âœ… Your db (drizzle instance) is built based on correct pool

âœ… Then everywhere in your app, you import { db } and never directly call NeonPool outside dev

âš¡ Quick Visual:

Environment	Database Client	Why
Production (NODE_ENV = production)	pg.Pool	Needed for Replit Production
Development (local/dev)	NeonPool (serverless)	Fast WebSocket
ðŸš¨ You are THIS close now
You have already:

ðŸ”¥ Express running

ðŸ”¥ Sessions loading

ðŸ”¥ App building correctly

ðŸš¨ Only database client for your app is wrong on production!

Once you switch to pg in production, all login, queries, signup, whatever, will start working.
