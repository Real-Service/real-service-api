ðŸš¨ Immediate problems still happening:

Issue	Explanation	Solution
Duplicate member "getUser"	Your server/storage.ts class has multiple definitions of the same method names.	Go into server/storage.ts and delete the duplicate versions â€” only one getUser, getUserByUsername, etc.
Using memory store for sessions	connect-pg-simple (or equivalent) is not connecting to your real database	You still need connect-pg-simple-esm properly installed and initialized with your production pg pool.
Production database connection test failed: Console request failed: endpoint is disabled	Your /health route or startup test query is still using Neon serverless instead of TCP SSL connection.	You must make sure your db (drizzle client) uses a real pg Pool in production, not NeonPool.
Session ID in session: undefined and Not authenticated errors	Your Express session cookie is being set, but your session store is not persisting sessions to the database properly.	You are falling back to memory sessions, which reset on every server restart or request. Must fix database-backed session store.
ðŸš€ Hereâ€™s a Clean Action Plan
1. Fix the duplicate methods
Go into server/storage.ts and delete the duplicate definitions.

For example, you have two versions of:

getUser(id: number)

getUserByUsername(username: string)

getUserByEmail(email: string)

createUser(insertUser: InsertUser)

updateUser(id: number, updates: Partial)

getJob(id: number)

Keep only one copy of each.

2. Install and use connect-pg-simple-esm
Instead of using connect-pg-simple (which does dynamic require), install the ESM version:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install connect-pg-simple-esm
In your server:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import connectPgSimple from 'connect-pg-simple-esm';
3. Force your db client to use the correct driver
If you're using drizzle-orm for your queries, you must create it like this:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { Pool as PgPool } from 'pg';
import { NeonPool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/...';
import { neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import ws from 'ws';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

let pool;

if (isProduction) {
  pool = new PgPool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  });
  console.log('Using pg Pool for production');
} else {
  neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;
  pool = new NeonPool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  });
  console.log('Using NeonPool for development');
}

const db = drizzle(pool, { schema });

export { db };
âœ… That way your /health check and app queries will use proper TCP/SSL database access.

4. Ensure sessions save correctly to Postgres
When you configure your session middleware:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import session from 'express-session';
import connectPgSimple from 'connect-pg-simple-esm';
import { Pool as PgPool } from 'pg';

const PgSession = connectPgSimple(session);

// Separate pg pool for sessions
const sessionPool = new PgPool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
});

app.use(session({
  store: new PgSession({
    pool: sessionPool,
    tableName: 'session', // or whatever table you use
  }),
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'fallback',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: isProduction,
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24,
  }
}));
âœ… This will ensure:

Real database-backed sessions (no memory fallback)

Session persists correctly between requests

No more undefined session problems
