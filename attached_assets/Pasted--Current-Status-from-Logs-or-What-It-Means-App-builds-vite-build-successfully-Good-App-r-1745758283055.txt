 Current Status from Logs:

✅ or ❌	What It Means
✅ App builds (vite build) successfully	Good
✅ App runs in production mode (NODE_ENV=production)	Good
✅ Using production Postgres TCP pool (pg.Pool) for app DB and sessions	Good
✅ Auth DB using connection type: BoundPool — using correct TCP SSL	Good
❌ Database healthcheck (or startup check) still tries to use Neon serverless somewhere	Minor leftover issue
❌ Session table still missing (Session table does not exist!)	Blocking sessions from working fully
🚨 Real problem now:

Critical Issue	Why It's Happening
Console request failed: endpoint is disabled	Somewhere in your app you're still trying to run a startup database test using Neon serverless client (likely leftover drizzle-orm healthcheck code or some auto-startup function).
Session persistence may fail...	Because your Postgres database does not have the session table created manually yet.
🛠️ Solutions you need to finish it off:
1. Manually create the session table in your database
✅ Go to your Postgres database (Neon dashboard, PgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)

✅ Run this SQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE "session" (
  "sid" varchar NOT NULL COLLATE "default",
  "sess" json NOT NULL,
  "expire" timestamp(6) NOT NULL
)
WITH (OIDS=FALSE);

ALTER TABLE "session" ADD CONSTRAINT "session_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("sid");

CREATE INDEX "IDX_session_expire" ON "session" ("expire");
After doing that:

Session cookies will properly persist in Postgres

No more memory session fallback warnings

Login sessions will be stable across page reloads

2. Fix the minor leftover "Console request failed"
✅ Somewhere early in your app startup (probably in your index.ts or server bootstrap)
you are doing a "test" query to check database connection,
but it’s using a drizzle client that still thinks it's Neon serverless.

You have two options:

✂️ Simply delete any "test query" at startup (not critical once your app is live and logging errors properly)

or

✅ Move your /health endpoint to use a new TCP-safe authDb client (like we did for login).

🚀 After you do those two things:

✅	
No more console request failures at boot	✅
Sessions save properly into Postgres	✅
Session IDs no longer undefined	✅
Login will persist after refresh	✅
You will be fully production-grade	✅
