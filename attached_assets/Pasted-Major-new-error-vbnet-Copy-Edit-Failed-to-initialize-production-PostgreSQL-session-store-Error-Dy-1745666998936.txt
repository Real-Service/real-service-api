Failed to initialize production PostgreSQL session store: Error: Dynamic require of "pg" is not supported
Translation:

Your server code is trying to do a require('pg') at runtime inside ESM (ECMAScript module) code.

In pure ESM mode (like you're running in production), you cannot use require(). You must use import.

Why is this happening now?
You are likely doing one of these somewhere:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const pg = require('pg');
or

javascript
Copy
Edit
const connectPgSimple = require('connect-pg-simple')(session);
inside a TypeScript/ESM project.

How to fix it:
✅ 1. Use import instead of require
At the top of your file, use:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import connectPgSimple from 'connect-pg-simple';
import pg from 'pg';
instead of any require().

✅ 2. If connect-pg-simple doesn’t support ESM cleanly (it sometimes doesn’t), you have two options:

Use a wrapper like createRequire from Node.js module package (messy).

Better: Replace connect-pg-simple with a modern alternative that fully supports ESM.

Example replacement that is ESM-ready:
🔵 connect-pg-simple-esm — a drop-in replacement.

To install:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install connect-pg-simple-esm
Then in your code:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import connectPgSimple from 'connect-pg-simple-esm';
and everything else stays almost identical.

Why are you getting "duplicate members" warnings?
This part from your logs:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
[WARNING] Duplicate member "getUser" in class body [duplicate-class-member]
means:

You accidentally defined the same method twice in the same TypeScript class.

Example problem:

typescript
Copy
Edit
class Storage {
  async getUser(id: number): Promise<User> {...}

  ...

  async getUser(id: number): Promise<User> {...} // <-- defined twice by mistake
}
🛠️ Simple fix:

Go into server/storage.ts.

Delete the duplicate method definitions.

Keep only one version of each function like getUser, createUser, updateUser, etc.

Summarizing the current fixes:

Problem	Fix
Dynamic require of "pg"	Switch all require to import, or install connect-pg-simple-esm
Duplicate class members	Remove duplicate method definitions in storage.ts
Session store fallback to memory	Once imports are correct, session store should connect properly to Postgres
