I see very clearly now what's happening from this latest screenshot.

🚨 New Status:

Symptom	Evidence	Interpretation
You logout — and server successfully clears the session	✅ API POST /api/logout returns 200 OK	
Local storage/session data is cleared	✅ Confirmed	
You are still shown as logged in on /auth page after logout	❌	
WebSocket is still trying to reconnect (wss handshake error 400)	❌ Critical	
🧠 True Root Cause (after this view)
WebSocket is trying to reconnect immediately after logout.

It fails (400 handshake) but your frontend wrongly re-sets auth state to "authenticated" when it tries to rehydrate.

Auth state logic is broken after WebSocket failure.

Even though you cleared cookies and tokens, the app reinitializes user data (from cache/memory) when the socket tries to reconnect and errors out.

You are missing a true "force auth recheck" after logout.

Frontend never verifies after logout if user is really logged out — it just "trusts" the in-memory store.

🎯 What Needs To Be Fixed (Absolutely)

Priority	Fix
🛑	You must fully close WebSocket connection on logout
🛑	You must reset all auth/user memory state (even hidden caches or session managers)
⚡	After logout, do a hard redirect to login page or force auth revalidation
⚡	Disable WebSocket client auto-reconnect unless user is authenticated
📋 Specific Code Changes Needed:
1. Close the WebSocket
During logout:

js
Copy
Edit
if (socket && socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
  socket.close(1000, 'Normal logout');
}
Prevents any reconnect attempts after logout.

2. Reset All In-Memory Auth Data
After clearing localStorage/sessionStorage, also manually clear auth memory:

js
Copy
Edit
authStore.set(null);  // Or Redux dispatch logout action
userData.set(null);
session.clear();      // If using session manager
3. Force Hard Redirect
After logout is complete:

js
Copy
Edit
window.location.href = '/login';
or

js
Copy
Edit
router.push('/login');
You need a clean page reload without any cached context.

4. Disable WebSocket Reconnect if Not Authenticated
Add a guard inside your WebSocket client code:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!userIsAuthenticated) {
  console.log("Skipping WebSocket connection because user is not logged in.");
  return;
}

const socket = new WebSocket(WS_URL);
No open socket unless a fresh auth token/user exists.

🔥 Critical: If you don't fix these, your app will continue to:
Auto-reconnect after logout

Think users are still logged in even without valid sessions

Leak user state between sessions

Fail security audits or real customer usage
