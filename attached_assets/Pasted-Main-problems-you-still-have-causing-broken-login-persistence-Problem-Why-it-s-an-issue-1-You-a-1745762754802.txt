Main problems you still have (causing broken login persistence):

Problem	Why it's an issue
1. You are setting session cookie maxAge: 0	This makes every cookie instantly expire after the login response finishes.
2. You temporarily disabled cookie-based authentication	Your own code: NOTICE: Cookie-based authentication is DISABLED. Using token-based auth only.
3. storage.sessionStore is still being used for session store	This is probably the wrong store! You should be using your new TCP-safe PostgreSQL session store, not storage.sessionStore.
üö® In plain English:
You are setting cookies.

But they expire immediately (maxAge: 0 = no lifetime).

So when the browser reloads or hits /api/user, it has no valid cookie.

Session ID is lost = "undefined session" = "Not authenticated."

üõ† Here‚Äôs exactly what you need to fix:
‚úÖ 1. Remove maxAge: 0 in session cookie.

Replace this:

typescript
Copy
Edit
cookie: { 
  maxAge: 0, // ‚ùå disables cookies immediately
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: 'none',
  path: '/'
}
with this instead:

typescript
Copy
Edit
cookie: { 
  maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, // ‚úÖ 1 day
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: 'none',
  path: '/'
}
‚úÖ This keeps cookies alive for 1 day (adjustable).

‚úÖ 2. Remove or re-enable cookie-based authentication.

Right now your log says:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
NOTICE: Cookie-based authentication is DISABLED. Using token-based auth only.
Remove this behavior.
You must allow cookies again for session persistence to work.

‚úÖ 3. Use the correct PostgreSQL session store, not storage.sessionStore.

Instead of:

typescript
Copy
Edit
store: storage.sessionStore,
‚úÖ You need to use the TCP-safe session store you built earlier:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import connectPgSimple from 'connect-pg-simple-esm';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pgSessionPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
});

const PgSession = connectPgSimple(session);

app.use(session({
  store: new PgSession({
    pool: pgSessionPool,
    tableName: 'session',
    createTableIfMissing: false,
  }),
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: true,
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'none',
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
    path: '/'
  }
}));
‚úÖ This connects ONLY using TCP, never Neon/WebSocket, and trusts the session table.
