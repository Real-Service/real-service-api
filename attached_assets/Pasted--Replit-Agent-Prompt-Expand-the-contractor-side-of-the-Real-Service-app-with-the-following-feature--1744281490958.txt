Implement this structure as modular React components using Tailwind CSS for styling. Use state management (e.g., context or Redux) to coordinate interactions between job listings, projects, and calendars. Ensure navigation is intuitive and mobile responsive. Each section should be fully functional or scaffolded with placeholders and stubs for future data hooks.
