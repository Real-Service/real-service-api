# Production Database Migration Report

## Overview
This report documents the process, progress, and results of migrating data from the source production database to the target production database.

**Source Database:** 
- Connection: `ep-sparkling-sound-a6f8kyru.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb`
- Region: us-west-2 (Western US)
- Tables: 26 tables identified

**Target Database:**
- Connection: `ep-dark-bird-a4xtgivw-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb`
- Region: us-east-1 (Eastern US)
- Initial state: 4 tables

## Migration Strategy

1. **Schema Transformation**
   - Implemented camelCase to snake_case column name transformation
   - Created initialization scripts for each table structure before migration
   - Maintained integrity of foreign key relationships

2. **Data Transfer Approach**
   - Sequential table migration to respect dependencies
   - Initialization of tables with proper structure in target database
   - Batch processing to handle potential volume

3. **Validation Procedures**
   - Post-migration record counting to ensure data completeness
   - Key relationship testing to verify referential integrity
   - Application functionality testing post-migration

## Schema Transformation Challenges

### Column Naming Conventions
The source database used camelCase column naming (e.g., `userId`, `contractorId`), while the target database uses snake_case naming convention (e.g., `user_id`, `contractor_id`). We implemented transformation logic to handle this difference.

### Sample Transformation Examples:
```javascript
// Sample transformation function
function transformColumnName(camelCaseName) {
  return camelCaseName.replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1_$2').toLowerCase();
}

// Examples:
// userId → user_id
// contractorId → contractor_id
// isUrgent → is_urgent
// termsAndConditions → terms_and_conditions
```

## Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **Schema Discrepancies**
   - Missing columns in target database tables
   - Different data types for some columns
   - Solution: Created initialization scripts to standardize schema

2. **Foreign Key Constraints**
   - Dependencies between tables required careful migration order
   - Solution: Implemented a dependency-aware migration sequence

3. **SSL Connection Issues**
   - Source database required SSL connection
   - Solution: Updated connection pool configuration with SSL settings

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Source database credential validation errors
   - Solution: Need to update authentication details for source database

## Next Steps

1. **Source Database Authentication** - Obtain correct credentials for source database access
2. **Complete Data Export** - Extract complete dataset from source database
3. **Complete Migration** - Run full migration with proper credentials
4. **Sequence Updates** - Update all sequences in the target database
5. **Validation** - Perform comprehensive validation of migrated data
6. **Application Testing** - Test the application against the target database

## Conclusion

The migration is partially complete with several key tables successfully migrated. The remaining tables have their structures properly initialized in the target database, ready for data migration. The primary roadblock is obtaining valid authentication for the source database to complete the data export and migration process.
