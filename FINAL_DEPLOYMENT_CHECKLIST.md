# Final Deployment Checklist for Real Service API

## Security First

- [ ] **REMOVE ALL SECRETS from deployment files**
- [ ] Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- [ ] Create a `.env.example` file with placeholders instead of real values
- [ ] Verify that `.gitignore` includes all secret files:
  - `.env`
  - `.env.local`
  - `.env.development`
  - `.env.production`
  - `secrets.txt`
  - Any file containing API keys

## Database Configuration

- [ ] Configure production database connection string as environment variable only
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded database credentials from the codebase
- [ ] Test database connection with `npm run test-production-db`

## API Keys & External Services

- [ ] Store API keys in environment variables only, never in code
- [ ] Remove any third-party service credentials from source code
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains

## Deployment Platform Setup

- [ ] Set all required environment variables in the deployment platform
- [ ] Configure health check endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] Set up proper logging and error tracking
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates

## Final Steps

- [ ] Run the deployment preparation script: `node prepare-deployment.js`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass before deploying
- [ ] Deploy application using the platform's interface
- [ ] Verify the deployment works with the test script: `node test-deployment.js [your-url]`

Remember: **Never commit secrets to version control!**
