# Deployment Instructions for Real Service API

I've implemented a complete solution for deploying your application to Render.com. The fix addresses the specific file path issue where Render was looking for `/opt/render/project/src/dist/index.js` but your TypeScript was compiling to `/opt/render/project/src/dist/server/index.js`.

## What I've Done

1. **Updated render.yaml**:
   - Changed the `buildCommand` to use our custom build script
   - Kept the `startCommand` pointing to the correct file path: `node dist/index.js`

2. **Enhanced render-build.sh**:
   - Added robust error handling and logging
   - Creates a symlink from `dist/index.js` to `dist/server/index.js`
   - Falls back to copying the file if the symlink fails
   - Has a final fallback to use the pure production server if needed

3. **Made the build script executable**:
   - Added execute permissions with `chmod +x render-build.sh`

## How to Deploy

1. **Push these changes to your repository**:
   ```bash
   git add render.yaml render-build.sh
   git commit -m "Fix deployment file path issue"
   git push
   ```

2. **In Render Dashboard**:
   - Go to your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" and select "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Monitor the build logs to ensure our script is working

3. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Check the `/healthz` endpoint to confirm the server is running
   - Check the `/api/status` endpoint to see detailed status information
   - Verify database connectivity with the `/api/database/test` endpoint

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Look for errors in the build logs
   - Verify our script is creating the file at `dist/index.js` as expected

2. **File Path Issues**:
   - Ensure the symlink or file copy is successful
   - Confirm the build process is completing properly

3. **Database Connectivity**:
   - Verify your DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly set
   - Check that the database is accessible from Render's network

## Next Steps

Once deployed successfully, you should be able to:

1. Connect your frontend to the API
2. Set up any additional environment variables needed
3. Configure custom domains if required

The application should now run properly without any Vite dependencies or file path issues.
